# Swole-iOS

Swole utilizes your Apple Watch to enhance your workout experience through personalized workouts and real time analysis. After starting your own custom workout, your phone or watch will give you real time feedback on your form and instruct you on how to correct it.

Our app offers real time analysis and feedback during a user's workout. Through the sensors on an Apple Watch, users can get real time response through visual and auditory means in order to best improve their form mid-set. Users can also utilize the app to create their own custom workouts with a wide range of exercises. Users then can set how many reps and sets they want to do of each exercise and rearrange the order of that workout. SWOLE will also give you real time progress on the number of reps and sets you still need to complete.
